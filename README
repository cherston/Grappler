Required Libraries: 

1. Simscape contact forces 
https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47417-simscape-multibody-contact-forces-library


Recommended Steps

1. Consult AIAA Scitech paper from January, 2019 proceedings to understand mechanism (Cherston et al. "Grappler: Bistable Arrays For Gripping Net-Like Infrastructure to Low Gravity Bodies" AIAA Scitech, 2019)

2. Watch videos generated from model and included in this repo

3. Download required libraries (listed above)

4. Run OneElementGrapplerModel (nonparametrized). Model shows a single element bistable pincher successfully grappling to a spherical surface. 

5. Consult ThreeElementGrapplerModel (partially parametrized). Set initial parameters by first running VariableInitGrapplerCubeTarget. Then run Simulink model. Note that expected compiling time is 15-20 minutes due to complexity of contact force model required. A

Note: as far as I can tell, The Simscape Contact Forces Library requires that a unique contact force be defined for every pair of planar surfaces that will come into contact, and this model has 8 surfaces on grappler and 4 surfaces on the cubic target object.  

6. Challenge: In my AIAA paper I have shown a successful grapple of a 3-element Grappler to a spherical target object. Can you choose settings in this model that make grappler stick to a cubic object?
